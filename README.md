## Overview

This project was created along side a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Reny0cTTv24&t=2s) to get a better understanding of working alongside with APIs.\
I constructed this project using two APIs: OpenWeatherMap API and the GeoDB API with Places Auto Complete.

* CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* OpenWeatherMap API
